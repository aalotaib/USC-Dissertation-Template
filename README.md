# USC Dissertation/Thesis LaTeX Template
LaTeX document-style for typesetting Theses or Dissertations in accordance with the University of Southern California Regulations for [Format and Presentation of Theses and Dissertations](http://graduateschool.usc.edu/current-students/thesis-dissertation-submission/guidelines-for-format-and-presentation/).
It provides some alternative "bells and whistles" such as support for multi-volume documents.

## History

A brief history of LaTeX templates for dissertation and thesis at the University of Southern California:

- 1987-1991: Steven Cochran (cochran@iris.usc.edu) wrote the original `USCthesis.sty`, and maintained this package file. You could still find it on [CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/uscthesis)
- 2000-2001: Zufar Mulyukov (zufarmul@physics.usc.edu) wrote the `USC-Thesis.cls` class file partially based on Cochran's package, as the latter has become outdated for both latex and USC thesis editor requirements.
- 2001-2003: Brian P. Gerkey (gerkey@robotics.usc.edu) continued the maintenance of `USCthesis.sty`.
- MISSING_EDIT_HISTORY
- 2023: Ali S. Alotaibi (aalotaib@usc.edu) cleaned and organized this template
- 2024: Amer Melebari (amelebar@usc.edu) replaced acronym package with acro package, added list of abbreviations,


This repository is based on Gerkey's work and aims at making the updated template easier to find and easier to use.
