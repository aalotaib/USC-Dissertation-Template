	abstract = {Due to the rapid increase of Android apps and their wide usage to handle personal data, a precise and large-scaling checker is in need to validate the apps' permission flow before they are listed on the market. Several tools have been proposed to detect sensitive data leaks in Android apps. But these tools are not applicable to large-scale analysis since they fail to deal with the arbitrary execution orders of different event handlers smartly. Event handlers are invoked by the framework based on the system state, therefore we cannot pre-determine their order of execution. Besides, since all exported components can be invoked by an external app, the execution orders of these components are also arbitrary. A naive way to simulate these two types of arbitrary execution orders yields a permutation of all event handlers in an app. The time complexity is O(n!) where n is the number of event handlers in an app. This leads to a high analysis overhead when n is big. To give an illustration, CHEX [10] found 50.73 entry points of 44 unique class types in an app on average. In this paper we propose an improved static taint analysis to deal with the challenge brought by the arbitrary execution orders without sacrificing the high precision. Our analysis does not need to make permutations and achieves a polynomial time complexity. We also propose to unify the array and map access with object reference by propagating access paths to reduce the number of false positives due to field-insensitivity and over approximation of array access and map access. We implement a tool, WeChecker, to detect privilege escalation vulnerabilities [7] in Android apps. WeChecker achieves 96\% precision and 96\% recall in the state-of-the-art test suite DriodBench (for compairson, the precision and recall of FlowDroid [1] are 86\% and 93\%, respectively). The evaluation of WeChecker on real apps shows that it is efficient (average analysis time of each app: 29.985s) and fits for large-scale checking.},

This paper describes a novel static analysis method "Precise-DF" to detect taint flow in Android app sets (including flows involving multiple apps) that is precise, fast, and uses relatively little disk and memory space. Precise-DF re-uses the fast modular analysis of the DidFail static analysis tool, and adds context and therefore precision with parameterized summaries of potential data flows. We added Boolean formulas to DidFail's flow equations, to record conditions of control flow paths relevant to possible taint flows. The method that we have refined (a modular analysis with parameterized summaries of flow of sensitive information) is generally applicable to the class of problems involving taint flow analysis for software systems that communicate by message passing. This paper also describes how an enterprise architecture could use Precise-DF to analyze and enforce compliance with dataflow policies.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes Flow Permissions, an extension to the Android permission mechanism. Unlike the existing permission mechanism, our permission mechanism contains semantic information based on information flows. Flow Permissions allow users to examine and grant per-app information flows within an application e.g., a permission for reading the phone number and sending it over the network) as well as cross-app information flows across multiple applications e.g., a permission for reading the phone number and sending it to another application already installed on the user's phone). Our goal with Flow Permissions is to provide visibility into the holistic behavior of the applications installed on a user's phone. In order to support Flow Permissions on Android, we have developed a static analysis engine that detects flows within an Android application. We have also modified Android's existing permission mechanism and installation procedure to support Flow Permissions. We evaluate our prototype with 2,992 popular applications and 1,047 malicious applications and show that our design is practical and effective in deriving Flow Permissions. We validate our cross-app flow generation and installation procedure on a Galaxy Nexus smartphone.},

Apposcopy incorporates (i) a high-level language for specifying signatures that describe semantic characteristics of malware families and (ii) a static analysis for deciding if a given application matches a malware signature. The signature matching algorithm of Apposcopy uses a combination of static taint analysis and a new form of program representation called Inter-Component Call Graph to efficiently detect Android applications that have certain control- and data-flow properties. We have evaluated Apposcopy on a corpus of real-world Android applications and show that it can effectively and reliably pinpoint malicious applications that belong to certain malware families.},

With known techniques in the literature, one may easily determine if sensitive data is being transmitted out of an Android phone. However, transmission of sensitive data in itself does not necessarily indicate privacy leakage; a better indicator may be whether the transmission is by user intention or not. When transmission is not intended by the user, it is more likely a privacy leakage. The problem is how to determine if transmission is user intended. As a first solution in this space, we present a new analysis framework called AppIntent. For each data transmission, AppIntent can efficiently provide a sequence of GUI manipulations corresponding to the sequence of events that lead to the data transmission, thus helping an analyst to determine if the data transmission is user intended or not. The basic idea is to use symbolic execution to generate the aforementioned event sequence, but straightforward symbolic execution proves to be too time-consuming to be practical. A major innovation in AppIntent is to leverage the unique Android execution model to reduce the search space without sacrificing code coverage. We also present an evaluation of AppIntent with a set of 750 malicious apps, as well as 1,000 top free apps from Google Play. The results show that AppIntent can effectively help separate the apps that truly leak user privacy from those that do not.},

	abstract = {Mobile malware attempts to evade detection during app analysis by mimicking security-sensitive behaviors of benign apps that provide similar functionality (e.g., sending SMS messages), and suppressing their payload to reduce the chance of being observed (e.g., executing only its payload at night). Since current approaches focus their analyses on the types of security-sensitive resources being accessed (e.g., network), these evasive techniques in malware make differentiating between malicious and benign app behaviors a difficult task during app analysis. We propose that the malicious and benign behaviors within apps can be differentiated based on the contexts that trigger security-sensitive behaviors, i.e., the events and conditions that cause the security-sensitive behaviors to occur. In this work, we introduce AppContext, an approach of static program analysis that extracts the contexts of security-sensitive behaviors to assist app analysis in differentiating between malicious and benign behaviors. We implement a prototype of AppContext and evaluate AppContext on 202 malicious apps from various malware datasets, and 633 benign apps from the Google Play Store. AppContext correctly identifies 192 malicious apps with 87.7\% precision and 95\% recall. Our evaluation results suggest that the maliciousness of a security-sensitive behavior is more closely related to the intention of the behavior (reflected via contexts) than the type of the security-sensitive resources that the behavior accesses.},

	abstract = {We present a new approach to static analysis for security vetting of Android apps and a general framework called Amandroid. Amandroid determines points-to information for all objects in an Android app component in a flow and context-sensitive (user-configurable) way and performs data flow and data dependence analysis for the component. Amandroid also tracks inter-component communication activities. It can stitch the component-level information into the app-level information to perform intra-app or inter-app analysis. In this article, (a) we show that the aforementioned type of comprehensive app analysis is completely feasible in terms of computing resources with modern hardware, (b) we demonstrate that one can easily leverage the results from this general analysis to build various types of specialized security analyses—in many cases the amount of additional coding needed is around 100 lines of code, and (c) the result of those specialized analyses leveraging Amandroid is at least on par and often exceeds prior works designed for the specific problems, which we demonstrate by comparing Amandroid’s results with those of prior works whenever we can obtain the executable of those tools. Since Amandroid’s analysis directly handles inter-component control and data flows, it can be used to address security problems that result from interactions among multiple components from either the same or different apps. Amandroid’s analysis is sound in that it can provide assurance of the absence of the specified security problems in an app with well-specified and reasonable assumptions on Android runtime system and its library.},

abstract = {Mobile devices are increasingly involved in crimes. Therefore, digital evidence on mobile devices plays a more and more important role in crime investigations. Existing studies have designed tools to identify and/or extract digital evidence in the main memory or the file system of a mobile device. However, identifying and extracting digital evidence from the logging system of a mobile device is largely unexplored. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap.Specifically, we design, prototype, and evaluate LogExtractor, the first tool to automatically identify and extract digital evidence from log messages on an Android device. Given a log message, LogExtractor first determines whether the log message contains a given type of evidentiary data (e.g., GPS coordinates) and then further extracts the value of the evidentiary data if the log message contains it. Specifically, LogExtractor takes an offline-online approach. In the offline phase, LogExtractor builds an App Log Evidence Database (ALED) for a large number of apps via combining string and taint analysis to analyze the apps' code. Specifically, each record in the ALED contains 1) the string pattern of a log message that an app may write to the logging system, 2) the types of evidentiary data that the log message includes, and 3) the segment(s) of the string pattern that contains the value of a certain type of evidentiary data, where we represent a string pattern using a deterministic finite-state automaton. In the online phase, given a log message from a suspect's Android device, we match the log message against the string patterns in the ALED and extract evidentiary data from it if the matching succeeds. We evaluate LogExtractor on 65 benchmark apps from DroidBench and 12.1 K real-world apps. Our results show that a large number of apps write a diverse set of data to the logging system and LogExtractor can accurately extract them.}

abstract = "Android security has been a hot spot recently in both academic research and public concerns due to numerous instances of security attacks and privacy leakage on Android platform. Android security has been built upon a permission based mechanism which restricts accesses of third-party Android applications to critical resources on an Android device. Such permission based mechanism is widely criticized for its coarse-grained control of application permissions and difficult management of permissions by developers, marketers, and end-users. In this paper, we investigate the arising issues in Android security, including coarse granularity of permissions, incompetent permission administration, insufficient permission documentation, over-claim of permissions, permission escalation attack, and TOCTOU (Time of Check to Time of Use) attack. We illustrate the relationships among these issues, and investigate the existing countermeasures to address these issues. In particular, we provide a systematic review on the development of these countermeasures, and compare them according to their technical features. Finally, we propose several methods to further mitigate the risk in Android security."

	isbn = {978-1-5386-2684-9},
	shorttitle = {{SEALANT}},
	abstract = {Android’s flexible communication model allows interactions among third-party apps, but it also leads to inter-app security vulnerabilities. Specifically, malicious apps can eavesdrop on interactions between other apps or exploit the functionality of those apps, which can expose a user’s sensitive information to attackers. While the state-of-the-art tools have focused on detecting inter-app vulnerabilities in Android, they neither accurately analyze realistically large numbers of apps nor effectively deliver the identified issues to users. This paper presents SEALANT, a novel tool that combines static analysis and visualization techniques that, together, enable accurate identification of inter-app vulnerabilities as well as their systematic visualization. SEALANT statically analyzes architectural information of a given set of apps, infers vulnerable communication channels where inter-app attacks can be launched, and visualizes the identified information in a compositional representation. SEALANT has been demonstrated to accurately identify inter-app vulnerabilities from hundreds of real-world Android apps and to effectively deliver the identified information to users.

	abstract = {Although a wide variety of approaches identify vulnerabilities in Android apps, none attempt to determine exploitability of those vulnerabilities. Exploitability can aid in reducing false positives of vulnerability analysis, and can help engineers triage bugs. Specifically, one of the main attack vectors of Android apps is their inter-component communication interface, where apps may receive messages called Intents. In this paper, we provide the first approach for automatically generating exploits for Android apps, called LetterBomb, relying on a combined path-sensitive symbolic execution-based static analysis, and the use of software instrumentation and test oracles. We run LetterBomb on 10,000 Android apps from Google Play, where we identify 181 exploits from 835 vulnerable apps. Compared to a state-of-the-art detection approach for three ICC-based vulnerabilities, LetterBomb obtains 33\%-60\% more vulnerabilities at a 6.66 to 7 times faster speed.},

	abstract = {Shake Them All is a popular "Wallpaper" application exceeding millions of downloads on Google Play. At installation, this application is given permission to (1) access the Internet (for updating wallpapers) and (2) use the device microphone (to change background following noise changes). With these permissions, the application could silently record user conversations and upload them remotely. To give more confidence about how Shake Them All actually processes what it records, it is necessary to build a precise analysis tool that tracks the flow of any sensitive data from its source point to any sink, especially if those are in different components. Since Android applications may leak private data carelessly or maliciously, we propose IccTA, a static taint analyzer to detect privacy leaks among components in Android applications. IccTA goes beyond state-of-the-art approaches by supporting inter-component detection. By propagating context information among components, IccTA improves the precision of the analysis. IccTA outperforms existing tools on two benchmarks for ICC-leak detectors: DroidBench and ICC-Bench. Moreover, our approach detects 534 ICC leaks in 108 apps from MalGenome and 2,395 ICC leaks in 337 apps in a set of 15,000 Google Play apps.},

In this paper, we provide a large, controlled, and independent comparison of the three most prominent static analysis tools: FlowDroid combined with IccTA, Amandroid, and DroidSafe. We evaluate all tools using common configuration setup and the same set of benchmark applications. We compare the results of our analysis to the results reported in previous studies, identify main reasons for inaccuracy in existing tools, and provide suggestions for future research.},

This paper describes a novel static analysis method "Precise-DF" to detect taint flow in Android app sets (including flows involving multiple apps) that is precise, fast, and uses relatively little disk and memory space. Precise-DF re-uses the fast modular analysis of the DidFail static analysis tool, and adds context and therefore precision with parameterized summaries of potential data flows. We added Boolean formulas to DidFail's flow equations, to record conditions of control flow paths relevant to possible taint flows. The method that we have refined (a modular analysis with parameterized summaries of flow of sensitive information) is generally applicable to the class of problems involving taint flow analysis for software systems that communicate by message passing. This paper also describes how an enterprise architecture could use Precise-DF to analyze and enforce compliance with dataflow policies.},

This paper demonstrates COVERT, a novel approach and accompanying tool-suite that relies on a hybrid static analysis and lightweight formal analysis technique to enable compositional security assessment of complex software. Through static analysis of Android application packages, it extracts relevant security specifications in an analyzable formal specification language, and checks them as a whole for inter-app vulnerabilities. To our knowledge, COVERT is the first formally-precise analysis tool for automated compositional analysis of Android apps. Our study of hundreds of Android apps revealed dozens of inter-app vulnerabilities, many of which were previously unknown.

Flow Permissions allow users to examine and grant per-app information flows within an application e.g., a permission for reading the phone number and sending it over the network) as well as cross-app information flows across multiple applications e.g., a permission for reading the phone number and sending it to another application already installed on the user's phone). Our goal with Flow Permissions is to provide visibility into the holistic behavior of the applications installed on a user's phone. In order to support Flow Permissions on Android, we have developed a static analysis engine that detects flows within an Android application. We have also modified Android's existing permission mechanism and installation procedure to support Flow Permissions. We evaluate our prototype with 2,992 popular applications and 1,047 malicious applications and show that our design is practical and effective in deriving Flow Permissions. We validate our cross-app flow generation and installation procedure on a Galaxy Nexus smartphone.},

	abstract = {Android phones often carry personal information, attracting malicious developers to embed code in Android applications to steal sensitive data. With known techniques in the literature, one may easily determine if sensitive data is being transmitted out of an Android phone. However, transmission of sensitive data in itself does not necessarily indicate privacy leakage; a better indicator may be whether the transmission is by user intention or not. When transmission is not intended by the user, it is more likely a privacy leakage. The problem is how to determine if transmission is user intended. As a first solution in this space, we present a new analysis framework called AppIntent. For each data transmission, AppIntent can efficiently provide a sequence of GUI manipulations corresponding to the sequence of events that lead to the data transmission, thus helping an analyst to determine if the data transmission is user intended or not. The basic idea is to use symbolic execution to generate the aforementioned event sequence, but straightforward symbolic execution proves to be too time-consuming to be practical. A major innovation in AppIntent is to leverage the unique Android execution model to reduce the search space without sacrificing code coverage. We also present an evaluation of AppIntent with a set of 750 malicious apps, as well as 1,000 top free apps from Google Play. The results show that AppIntent can effectively help separate the apps that truly leak user privacy from those that do not.},

	abstract = {Mobile malware attempts to evade detection during app analysis by mimicking security-sensitive behaviors of benign apps that provide similar functionality (e.g., sending SMS messages), and suppressing their payload to reduce the chance of being observed (e.g., executing only its payload at night). Since current approaches focus their analyses on the types of security-sensitive resources being accessed (e.g., network), these evasive techniques in malware make differentiating between malicious and benign app behaviors a difficult task during app analysis. We propose that the malicious and benign behaviors within apps can be differentiated based on the contexts that trigger security-sensitive behaviors, i.e., the events and conditions that cause the security-sensitive behaviors to occur. In this work, we introduce AppContext, an approach of static program analysis that extracts the contexts of security-sensitive behaviors to assist app analysis in differentiating between malicious and benign behaviors. We implement a prototype of AppContext and evaluate AppContext on 202 malicious apps from various malware datasets, and 633 benign apps from the Google Play Store. AppContext correctly identifies 192 malicious apps with 87.7\% precision and 95\% recall. Our evaluation results suggest that the maliciousness of a security-sensitive behavior is more closely related to the intention of the behavior (reflected via contexts) than the type of the security-sensitive resources that the behavior accesses.},

abstract = {In recent years, researchers have developed a number of tools to conduct taint analysis of Android applications. While all the respective papers aim at providing a thorough empirical evaluation, comparability is hindered by varying or unclear evaluation targets. Sometimes, the apps used for evaluation are not precisely described. In other cases, authors use an established benchmark but cover it only partially. In yet other cases, the evaluations differ in terms of the data leaks searched for, or lack a ground truth to compare against. All those limitations make it impossible to truly compare the tools based on those published evaluations.  We thus present ReproDroid, a framework allowing the accurate comparison of Android taint analysis tools. ReproDroid supports researchers in inferring the ground truth for data leaks in apps, in automatically applying tools to benchmarks, and in evaluating the obtained results. We use ReproDroid to comparatively evaluate on equal grounds the six prominent taint analysis tools Amandroid, DIALDroid, DidFail, DroidSafe, FlowDroid and IccTA. The results are largely positive although four tools violate some promises concerning features and accuracy. Finally, we contribute to the area of unbiased benchmarking with a new and improved version of the open test suite DroidBench.},
